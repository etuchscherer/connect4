# Connect4

## Installation

from a terminal perform the following:

    cd ~/Sites && git clone https://github.com/etuchscherer/connect4.git && cd connect4
    npm install && bower install

## Useage

from a terminal perform the following:

    cd ~/Sites/connect4
    node app.js

alternatively, if developing, you can use _runjs_ to watch the connect4 directory for changes. It will restart your node server if you make changes to it.

    // to install runjs
    npm -g install run
    
    // to start runjs
    cd ~/Sites/connect4
    runjs app.js
